# FEDAssigment1
This is my FED assignment 1 project. 

I am in the process of designing a website for a fictional brand known as 'The Ronans,' specializing in bags. The aesthetic I aim to evoke is a blend of classiness with an edgy undertone. To achieve this, the images featured on the website exclusively showcase black leather bags, as I believe this palette perfectly encapsulates the essence of 'The Ronans.
# Design Proess
As I was crafting the design for this website, my primary focus was to ensure a seamless and enjoyable experience for my users, coupled with an appealing visual aesthetic. To achieve this, I drew inspiration from established bag brands such as Good Totes and Paper Bunny, meticulously studying the features that resonated with me as a user. By distilling the essence of their websites, I aimed to incorporate functionalities that not only enhance user interaction but also elevate the overall aesthetic of 'The Ronans.'

I identified specific elements from these renowned brands, listing them as goals and inspiration for my own website. The intention is to create a website that not only meets but exceeds user expectations. My ultimate goal is to captivate first-time visitors to 'The Ronans' website, instilling an immediate fondness for its aesthetic appeal. Simultaneously, I aspire to foster trust by presenting a professionally designed platform that reflects the quality of **The Ronans** brand. Through this approach, I aim to establish a positive and lasting impression, ensuring that users not only appreciate the products but also feel a strong sense of confidence in their online interaction with **The Ronans**.

Provided below are the links to the research conducted prior to the development phase of my website. The accompanying wireframe serves as a visual representation, bringing to life the vision I have in mind:
